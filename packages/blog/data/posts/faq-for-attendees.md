Discover the details of Show Up in this comprehensive FAQ guide. Find answers to common questions about events, registering, checking in, and earning money by showing up.

### What is Show Up?

Show Up is an on-chain RSVP and Event management protocol designed to reshape event participation. It introduces a novel staking mechanism that aligns the incentives between event organizers and attendees. [More info here](https://blog.showup.events/introducing-show-up-protocol).

### How can I join an event?

Any event on [Show Up](https://www.showup.events/) is public. You can join any event by paying the deposit fee on the event page to secure your spot.

### Can I edit my registration after signing up?

No, registrations are final. Make sure to double-check the event details before confirming your attendance.

### What if I can't attend after registering?

If you're unable to attend, make sure to contact your event organizer on time to inform them. This may free up space for others to join. Your deposit will be lost and distributed among checked-in attendees at the end of the event.

### How do I check in at an event?

Simply show up at the event, and the organizer will check you in. Make sure to bring your ticket or proof of registration.

### How much is the deposit fee?

The deposit fee is set by the organizer. Check the event details to find the specified amount.

### How do I pay for the deposit fee?

The currency and fee are set by the organizer. Show Up currently supports native Ether or ERC20 stablecoins, like USDC, USDT, and DAI. It's only deployed on Optimism; make sure your funds are available there in order to register for an event.

### How can I make money?

If you show up at the event, your deposit will be returned to you along with a share of the unclaimed deposits.

### Joined an event but didn't get money back?

The organizer checks and settles the event to distribute funds. This process takes time and can only happen after the event has ended, so please be patient. When in doubt, make sure to contact the event organizer. Show Up is not able to retrieve, settle or collect any of the funds.

### I have another question. How can I get support for Show Up?
